An efficient digital watermarking algorithm using wavelet transform is proposed for copyright protection. The performance of the algorithm has been measured using different Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWTs) such as Haar, Daubechies-10, Symlet 8, Coieflets 5 and  Biorthogonal 3.5 wavelets. This algorithm embeds a logo as watermark in original image by modifying the subband image in wavelet domain.  The Approximation, Horizontal and Vertical coefficient of logo image is separately added to the approximation coefficient of original image and  Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is performed to get watermarked image. The image quality assessment between watermarked image and original image has been measured in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Weighted Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WPSNR) and Structural SIMilarity Index (SSIM) for standard test image Lena.jpeg. The spatial domain technique using Least Significant Bit (LSB) has been studied to compare the results with DWTs. Based on the present study, the performance of Biorthogonal 3.5 wavelet is found to be better than other wavelet transforms and LSB approach. It has been reported that LSB is less secure than wavelet transforms, so one should prefer the wavelet transform for digital watermarking.
